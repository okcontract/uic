# OKcontract UI Components

**OKcontract UI Components** is an open-source UI component library built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). This library aids in streamlining the development of front-ends for various projects.

## Cells Functional Reactive Library

A distinctive feature of this library is the integration of [Cells](https://github.com/okcontract/cells), a functional reactive library. It's important to note that this integration is a work in progress (WIP) as we are currently in the process of migrating components to **cells**.

## Svelte UI Components

OKcontract UI Components is a collection of over 30 Svelte UI components and utilities. The interactivity of these components is efficiently managed by Svelte, encompassing stores and actions for dynamic user experiences.

## Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

For styling, OKcontract UI Components use Tailwind CSS, an open-source, utility-first CSS framework together with DaisyUI, free and open-source Tailwind CSS component library. DaisyUI classes are used for components' appearance offering multiple style and size choices for each component.

## Typescript

To enhance the development experience, OKcontract UI Components is built using Typescript. This adds an extra layer of efficiency and reliability to the development process.

## Team

The library is developed by the [OKcontract](https://okcontract.com/) team and supported by a RFG grant from [Optimism](https://optimism.io).
